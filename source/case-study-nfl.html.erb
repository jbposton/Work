				<p> A large media company had one goal when updating the their football app for the web: Make the experience work across all devices and screen-sizes. But, with a tight deadline, and even tighter budget, a full responsive upgrade was not feasible for this all-in-one video and stats experience.</p>

			<p>After researching and validating the actual user need, I designed and prototyped a new solution that not only met our business goals and engineering capabilties, but became a hit with users; landing the feature as the default setting for the the entire suite of apps. </br></br> We called it <em>Stadium Mode</em>.

			<h1>Discovering Constraints and Prioritizing Opportunities</h1>
			<h2>Research, Strategy</h2>
			<p class="text">
			Although the product owners asked for a responsive update, after several talks with engineering, it was clear that a more gradual approach was necessary. As a result, we had to prioritize the updates&#8212;a necessary step in almost all projects.
			</br></br>
			My favorite prioritization tool is user research&#8212;even if only a small amount, a few insights goes a long way. 
			</br></br>
			I created a short <em>research plan</em> to gain better insight into how users access the product and how they might use a more fluid web experience. The research was quick and lean but the findings were inspiring.

				 	<h5>Insights</h5>
				 	<p><em>When asked why they used the web app:</em></br>Most people said they used it when they were busy doing other things online.</p>
				 	<p><em>When asked what device they use to access the content:</em></br>Most participants said, just desktop. If they were on their phone or tablet, they just used the native app. </p></br></br>
				 	<p>With the interview results, I was able to validate my assumption that most users want to multi-task when using the web app. They were interested in scaling the video within a desktop context but not necessarily needing it to scale to their mobile device.</p>

			<h1>Ideation and Iterations</h1>
			<h2>Interaction Design</h2>
			<p class="text">Working with the existing structure, ideations ususally start by <em>sketching on paper</em> or whiteboarding. I led <em>working sessions</em> with the client team to validate/invalidate preliminary approaches.</p>

			<p class="text">I fleshed out our favorite ideas into <em>wireframes</em>; testing the limits using realistic content. I presented iterations to the client team every step of the way.</p>

			<h1>Prototyping a Solution</h1>
			<h2>Prototyping, User Testing</h2>
			<p class="text">The final iteration did not focus on making parts of the app responsive but focused on what users cared about the most: watching the game while doing other things. </br></br>
			To test and communicate a more refined concept, we raised the fidelity up a notch. Working with another designer who created high-fidelity assets, I <em>prototyped</em> the interactions and user flow using HTML, CSS, and little bit of JS magic. This helped communicate the desired behavior to both the engineers and product owners and gave us something to put in front of the users.</p>
			</br>
			<span class="caption">The feature was called "stadium mode" and it let the users view just the live video module in a scalable browser. Click the image below to watch a video of a preliminary prototype.</span>

			<h1>User Testing</h1>
			<p class="text"> A refined version of the prototype and a set of <em>test cases</em> I wrote were given to the research team in order to test the discoverability and general demand for the new feature.</p>
			<p class="text"> <em>3 out of 5</em> users successfully discovered the new feature.</p>
			<p class="text"> <em>4 out of 5</em> preferred the new feature over other options and the current experience.</p>

			<h1>Outcomes</h1>
			<p class="text"> Ultimately, the final solution was pretty simple. But it allowed the user to do what they wanted to do in the first place&#8212;scale their video while doing other things. It also leveraged existing HTML capabilities, effectively requiring very little work from the engineering department. </br></br>
			Under budget and user approved, the feature has since been added to the entire suite of apps, including native mobile and tablet versions. It is now the default mode when first opening the app.</p>
