				<div class="brief-text">DIRECTV approached us to help update and improve the user experinece of their most popular consumer facing app, NFL Sunday Ticket. Originally created as an iPad and Android app, the app gives fans access to all Sunday games alongside realtime statistics, highlights and player information. For the update, we were tasked with improving the usability and UX of the app while also scaling the designs to larger devices as users were requesting the content on these devices more and more. Focusing on the content users cared about the most, we recommended and implemented design updates that scaled across new, larger devices in order to make for a more rich and engaging multi-platform experience.

						<h2>Discovering opportunities and constraints</h2>
						<p class="first-graf">As a part of the updated we wanted to make sure the app and its structure reflected and prioritized the content our users wanted the most. I used analytics reports and reviewed feedback logs as a basis for what needed improving.</p>
						<p>Additionally, I conducted a Heuristic Evaluation on the original app, hoping to better understand the feedback and identify areas for improvements.

						<p class="caption inline">The UI elements in the game panel did not create a clear connection between the controls and the items being controlled. The Date filter was not directly above the game live games it would filter. This potentially obstructed the users’ ability to find and watch previous games after they have aired.</p>
